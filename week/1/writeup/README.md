### Part 2 (75 pts)
This is a massive problem that has to be dealt with immediately. If you don't deal with the issue once you understand it's
a problem then you are also responsible for the deaths/injuries/damage it causes. Depending on how many cars are bought from this 
company many people will get hurt from this software so from here we have to work on attempting to fix the issue. First, bring
up the issue to your boss and see if they can be convinced of the severity of the problem. If your boss agrees to reworking the
entire system and the company also agrees to it then you can go back to work trying to fix the problems in the *ECU*. However, 
if the company does not take the issue seriously and is still willing to release this software for public consumption that's 
when you have to become a whistleblower. You have to become a whistleblower because you understand the damage that this faulty
*ECU* can cause and since you're the only one that appears to be taking the issue seriously then you have to act on it immediately.
From here go directly to a consumer watchdog group and depending on how long there is until the software is released go 
right to a major newspaper as well. These groups will work to inform the public and stop the company dead in its tracks. If you do
lose your job in this then attempt to use federal laws on protecting whistleblowers to get some compensation back.
